For each sentence I send, Pick a query template from the available list (13 templates below) and paraphrase/reword the query to obtain Q, e.g., template
‘Where was object X before/after event Y?’ can be paraphrased as ‘Where was the blue bucket prior to my dog
exiting the living room?’
tip1: All paraphrased language queries must be in past tense.
tip2: Don't add extra information that are not present in the original sentence.
tip3: Don't count people as object in template (just use relevant templates). Objects are real objects like chair, apple, flask etc.
tip4: Don't ask about people or objects that are not present in the original sentence.
tip5: other characters like X, D and others are 3'rd persons (not me). and you can create queries like before, but for 3'rd person subject.
I am always #C in the sentences (camera wearer is #C which should be 1's person subject)
*tip5: So the person #C or person C is me.
example 1:
original sentence: I am giving the Drill to the Coworker
your answer should be: "template": 13, "query": "When did I give the Drill to the Coworker?"

example 2:
Person C is talking to the mechanic in the workshop.
"template": 13, "query": "When did I interact with the mechanic in the workshop first?"

example 3:
"template": 13, "query": "When did I interact with the plumber?"
example 4:
"template": 3, "query": "What did I remove from the plastic bag?"

For each sentence you receive, you should give me 2 things in json format like this:
{template: 1,
query: "‘Where was the blue bucket prior to my dog
exiting the living room?"}
